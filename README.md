# Project Four-Team Four

This repository contains the files generated by Team 4 for Project 4.

**Project Overview:**

Our objective is to use NCAA men's basketball performance statistics to predict outcomes of team matchups.

**Our Data Source**
  -Data was scraped from www.basketball-reference.com

**Our analysis steps included:**

  -Using python and beautiful soup, scrape data from the NCAAWebApp url
  
  -Using python and pandas, clean the data and prepare for analysis
  
  -Using google colab, pandas, numpy and hvplot, created visualizations of the team statistics, comparing relevant performance statistics to team's success in getting to the sweet 16.
  
  -Created models of the data in order to predict outcomes of matchup betweens schools within the NCAA. First a correlation matrix is created, and highly correlated columns were dropped.  Then the data is scaled using Robus Scaler. Then the data is split, trained and tested. Next a hpyerparameter tuning method is applied using GridSearchCV. Next the model is evaluated, and a prediction is made on the entire datasest. Residual sigma for condifence estimation is computed, and the SRS weight is optimized using the test set.  The model and associated objects are saved.
  
  -Create a flask application to allow easy user interface
A flask enpoint was created, to allow user interaface to plug specific teams into the model.
